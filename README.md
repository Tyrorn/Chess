# Chess

This is a 95% implemented chess game created to further teach me javascript HTML and css.

To do list:
  The only component left to implement is the rook/castle swap.
  Do some further testing to ensure all components work correctly.
  Optimize code,
  improve design

Future features include theme changes which will allow users to adjust the theme of the background and pieces on the playing board.
